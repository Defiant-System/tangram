### What is a Tangram
A Tangram puzzle focuses on the objective to rearrange the seven separate pieces into a complete image of various shapes *(in outline or silhouette only)*.
Coming from China, this logic game brings the mathematical thought of Asia and incorporates it with bright colours and charming figures.

### How to
The classic rules are simple: all tangram pieces *(or tans)* must be used, they must lay flat, all must touch and none may overlap.

### History
Tangram puzzles originated in Imperial China during the Tang Dynasty, they are thought to have travelled to Europe in the 19th century on trading ships.
Tangram puzzles were popular during World War 1 and have become the most popular dissection puzzle in the world. Besides, tangram patterns have also been described as early psychological tests.

Tangram patterns are called in China "Chin-Chiao Pan" meaning intriguing seven piece puzzle.
A book published in China in 1815 by Shan-Chiao contains 374 puzzle patterns.
Early Chinese mathematicians manipulated geometric shapes in their problem solving. A technique that is still applied in classrooms today, inter alia, through the use of tangrams.
